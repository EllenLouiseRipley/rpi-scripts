HoneyPi is a measuring system based on the Raspberry Pi. It is an open source framework, which allows every beekeeper to monitor his bees. The data transfer takes place to the Internet of Things platform ThingSpeak. The measurement data is collected at the apiary and visualized in apps.

## Install
