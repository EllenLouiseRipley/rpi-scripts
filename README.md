HoneyPi is a measuring system based on the Raspberry Pi. It is an open source framework, which allows every beekeeper to monitor his bees. The data transfer takes place to the Internet of Things platform ThingSpeak. The measurement data is collected at the apiary and visualized in apps.

## Install

Check out the [main repo](https://github.com/Honey-Pi/HoneyPi#install) on how to install the entire measurement system on your Raspberry Pi Image with just a few commands. Or simply download a ready HoneyPi image from our [download page](https://www.honey-pi.de/downloads/). You can even create your own custom HoneyPi images using our [Raspbian image generator](https://github.com/Honey-Pi/HoneyPi-Build-Raspbian).

## Update to latest development state

1. Flash the [provided HoneyPi Image](https://www.honey-pi.de/downloads/) to your SD Card OR run our [installer](https://github.com/Honey-Pi/HoneyPi#install) which installs the webinterface and the measurement scripts to your Raspberry Pi.
